        <!--<h1>DESCRIPTION OF SDS SERVICES</h1>-->
        <!--<div class="heading">-->
        <!--   Our Responsibility and Rules of Conduct:-->
        <!--</div>-->
        <!--<p>-->
        <!--   Our purpose is to create a powerful tool for all Service and Assistance Dog handlers regardless of certification levels, training methods or other affiliations. At the core of that is our deep commitment to do the right thing in all aspects of our business including how we treat the environment, our customers and the Service Dog community as a whole. Our intention is to create a friendly and open resource.-->
        <!--</p>-->

        <!--<div class="heading">-->
        <!--   Participant's Responsibility and Rules of Conduct:-->
        <!--</div>-->
        <!--<p>-->
        <!--   We expect and hope that you will use this Service as intended and in a responsible and respectful manner. Membership is conducted under the honor system and any individual found to violate these rules will be expelled from the Service. All Trainers, Owners, Handlers (Members) and Animals must qualify under the United States Department of Justice's Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Please visit http://www.ada.gov for more information if you need clarification. SDS is not intended to be a certification process and we do not judge the proficiency of our Members in any way, and nor would that be necessary under the law. Of course, we can not be responsible or liable for the actions of dog owners or their dogs either online or offline.-->
        <!--</p>-->
        <!--<p>-->
        <!--   SDS provides Services only to Members who conform to the United States Department of Justice Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Our services provide no protection above or beyond the law. We are a tool, similar to an online resume or other online profile service. All data that is used is based solely on the assertions of the provider or Members themselves.-->
        <!--</p>-->
        <!--<p>-->
        <!--   You understand and agree that SDS Services are provided "AS IS" and that SDS assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, misdelivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to SDS Services, and that access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment (ie. your computer, laptop or other wire-less device) necessary to access SDS Services.-->
        <!--</p>-->



        <!--<h1>YOUR MEMBERSHIP OBLIGATIONS</h1>-->
        <!--In consideration of your use of SDS Services, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving SDS Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. That means all SDS Members must conform fully to the current ADA law, meaning that you or the Member are the legal and rightful owner and user of a Service or Assistance Animal as described by the United States Department of Justice Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). It is the responsibility of Members and users to understand and obey the ADA law online and offline. Other types of pets and working dogs including, but not limited to Therapy Dogs, Police Dogs and Agility Dogs are strictly forbidden from SDS and using the SDS Services or Website. This is true unless an animal meets the ADA requirements but is also dually trained to act as both a Service or Assistance Animal as well as to fulfill other duties such as that of a Therapy Dog. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the SDS Service's Membership form (the "Membership Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Membership Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or SDS has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, SDS has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of SDS Services (or any portion thereof) without any notice to you.-->

        <!--<h1>SDS PRIVACY POLICY</h1>-->
        <!--Membership and Profile Data and certain other information about you are subject to our applicable Privacy Policy. For more information, see the full SDS Privacy Policy at-->
        <!--<router-link to="/privacy">serviceDogStandards.org/privacy</router-link>.-->
        <!--You understand that through your use of SDS Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the applicable privacy policy) of this information.-->


        <!--<h1>MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY</h1>-->
        <!--You will create a password and account designation upon completing the SDS Service's Membership process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify SDS of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. SDS cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 5.-->

        <!--<h1>MEMBER CONDUCT</h1>-->
        <!--<p>-->
        <!--   You understand that all information, data, text, photographs, graphics, messages or other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not SDS, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the SDS Services. SDS does not control the Content posted to areas such as, but not limited to, Profile Pages and Blog comments via the SDS Services and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. SDS is constantly updated with new Content from users, so although we hope it does not happen, you understand that by using the SDS Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. We will make a reasonable effort to remove such content. Under no circumstances will SDS be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to objectionable or offensive Content in Profile Pages, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, e-mailed, transmitted or otherwise made available either online or offline.-->
        <!--</p>-->
        <!--<p>-->
        <!--   We reserve the right to remove anyone from SDS at any time who is determined to be violating the ADA and/or our TOS. In addition if you or your Service Animal is involved in any act of aggression or violence towards a person, other animal or property your Membership with us will be considered wholly invalid and possibly fraudulent from the moment it was created. We believe Service and Assistance dog teams must behave in exemplary fashion at all times. We may not be held liable in any way for the actions of our members or their animals either online or offline as they are 100% responsible for themselves at all times.-->
