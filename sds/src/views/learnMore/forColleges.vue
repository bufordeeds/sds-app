            Service Dog Standards Helps Schools
          </div>
          Colleges and universities are often wary of granting access to Service Dog teams. Schools may use Service Dog Standards to help manage and educate Service Dog teams on campus and in dorms.
          <span class="br" />
          Rather than reinvent the wheel, schools refer students and staff to Service Dog Standards.





          <div class="lm-heading">
            Education, Safety and Responsibility
          </div>

          In order to help handlers remember their responsibilities and obligations of being partnered with a Service Dog, our training and behavior standards agreement needs to be renewed (for free) every four years. We’ll take care of sending reminder emails — and we’ve tried to make the renewing process as simple as possible.
          <span class="br" />
          If a Service Dog team proves unable to meet our standards, we may suspend or remove their membership.
          <span class="br" />
          Together, we can help educate Service Dog handlers about their obligations and responsibilities while allowing you to focus on doing what you do best.

            How to Get Started
          </div>

          It’s easy to get started. Simply refer students to sign up for free at Service Dog Standards.
