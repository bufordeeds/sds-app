        Physicians and therapists are often reluctant to write letters for their patients, verifying their need for a Service Dog, and there are a lot of excellent reasons why. Service Dog Standards can help.
        <span class="br" />
        Physicians and therapists use Service Dog Standards as a method to help educate Service Dog owners about their obligations and responsibilities.

        <div class="lm-heading">
          Are Physician or Therapist Letters Required for Service Dogs?
        </div>

        Letters from a medical or mental health professional are not required for public access, though they may be requested for housing or airline travel.

        <div class="lm-heading">
          Letters from a medical or mental health professional can be a helpful form of additional documentation for Service Dog owners.
        </div>

        Medical or mental health professionals are able to attest to the nature of an individual’s disability and recommend, verify or make an educated guess at a patient’s need for a Service Dog.

          Problems with Therapist and Physician Letters
        </div>


        Physician and therapist letters can be a helpful form of documentation for a Service Dog team, however they aren’t without problems.


        <div class="lm-heading">
          Medical Letters Are Being Sold Online
        </div>

        If you need a medical letter, please get one the right way. There is a rise in websites featuring alleged (and sometimes real) physicians and therapists who sell dubious medical letters without ever meeting patients.


        <div class="lm-heading">
          Physicians and Therapists Are Not Qualified to Evaluate a Dog’s Training
        </div>

        Physicians and therapists are qualified to care for their patients, but they are not qualified to verify the training, the viability of trained tasks or the behavior of a dog.


        <div class="lm-heading">
          Many Physicians and Therapists Feel Uncomfortable Writing Letters
        </div>

        Vouching for the training of patient’s dog falls well outside a physician’s scope, leaving many physicians reluctant to write letters. Service Dogs are not “prescribed” by a doctor like medicine or a medical procedure. Physicians and therapists may be able to verify the need for a Service Dog, but not its training or behavior or the training and behavior of their patient.


        <div class="lm-heading">
          Physician or Therapist Letters Are a Privileged Form of Documentation
        </div>

        If you have access to money, it is relatively easy to find someone to write a letter recommending or verifying the need for a Service Dog. Many disabled individuals are on low or limited income.


        <div class="lm-heading">
          Many Disabled Individuals Rely on Urgent Care Facilities
        </div>

        Instead of having a primary care physician or mental health therapist, many disabled individuals rely solely on Urgent Care facilities including Immediate Care facilities or Emergency Departments where they are assigned a random physician each visit.


        <div class="lm-heading">
          Some Disabilities Are Easier to Obtain Letters For Than Others
        </div>

        Disabilities which are visible are easier to obtain letters for than invisible disabilities.


        <div class="lm-heading">
          The Disability Itself May Make it Harder
        </div>
        In order to obtain a physician or therapist letter, a patient needs to be able to advocate for themselves and their need for a Service Dog.
        Some physical or mental health disabilities have factors or symptoms that make demonstrating the confidence and equanimity necessary for self-advocacy challenging or impossible.

          What Should a Physician or Therapist Letter Contain?
        </p>


        Letters from a physician or therapist should be printed on their letterhead and should not mention specifics about your disability:




        <div
          style="display: flex; justify-content: center"
          class="pl-8 pr-8 mt-4"

            Dear _________________________, <br>

            <p>
              _________________________ is my patient, and has been under my care since [DATE].  My patient meets the definition of disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and I am intimately familiar with their history and with the functional limitations imposed by their disability.
            </p>


            <p>
              In order to help alleviate these difficulties, my patient is partnered with a Service Dog which is trained to complete tasks they would otherwise have difficulty completing on their own.
            </p>


            <p>
              Upon request, I would be happy share professional literature and articles citing the benefits of Service Dogs for people with disabilities. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding my recommendation.
            </p>
