                  Service Dogs do not always make life easier
               </div>


               Before you begin to explore partnering with a Service Dog, you should know that they do not always make life easier and you should fully consider it.
               <span class="br"/>
               Please read <a href="https://anythingpawsable.com/before-partnering-with-a-service-dog/">5 Questions to Ask Before Partnering With a Service Dog</a>


               <div class="lm-heading">
                  Understand your disability and how a service dog can help
               </div>

               The first step is to know what you want. You should be able to clearly explain the limitations of you disability and what problems you encounter that can be assisted with a Service Dog. Do you need mobility assistance? Auditory alerts for doorbells? Sit down and make a simple list of the tasks you need performed.


               <div class="lm-heading">
                  Simply being disabled and having a dog isn't enough
               </div>

               Many disabled people have pets. Service Dogs must be trained to perform specific physical tasks or work that you would otherwise have difficulty completing on your own due to your disability.

               <div class="lm-heading">
                  Finding the right dog
               </div>

               Although Service Dogs come in all breeds and sizes, not all dogs are cut out to become Service Dogs. Your pet may be lovely — in fact we are sure your pet is wonderful! However a good pet does not necessarily make a good service animal.
               <span class="br"/>
               It’s important to consider demeanor, size, trainability and energy level to fid the right match. A large german shepherd can be excellent for visual impairment and mobility guidance but a smaller animal might be a better fit if you have limited physical space or need medicine retrieved from small spaces.



               <div class="lm-heading">
                  Training your Service Dog
               </div>


               Some people choose to receive their dog fully trained, others choose to work with a private trainer or train their dog themselves.
               <span class="br"/>
               If you don’t have experience training animals, we recommend you work with a trainer or get a dog from an organization that provides fully trained service dogs.
               <span class="br"/>
               There is no “formal” test for Service Dogs because the tasks Service Dogs can be trained to perform vary too widely. Furthermore, under the law it is illegal for anyone to ask for proof of training or certification. The ADA is written this way because it is a civil rights law designed level the playing field for disabled people — not add challenges for them. If any form of "paperwork," "certification" or "licensing" were required Service Dog handlers could and would be stopped and forced to show proof to whomever asks, or, if police are only allowed to ask, police would be routinely called on Service Dog owners who are just trying to go about their day.


               <div class="lm-heading">
                  How do I find a trainer?
               </div>


               Some people are surprised to learn that there are no legally-mandated training standards for Service Dogs — or even for dog trainers. Interview trainers and find someone you feel is a good fit for you and your dog.
               <span class="br"/>
               Depending on your disability, you may wish to search for trainers or organizations that specialize in training animals for tasks related to the type of disability you have. Organizations often have waiting lists, some may charge nothing, others may charge $20,000 or more depending on a variety of factors.
               <span class="br"/>
               You may also develop a list of tasks on your own and then contact a local dog trainer. Tasks or work are things your dog is trained to perform to help mitigate your disability.

               </div>


               For your own safety, Service Dogs should be able to perform their trained work or tasks on cue, every time they’re needed — even if there are distractions.

                  How do I know what tasks qualify?
               </div>
               There’s no list of “qualifying” mental, physical or sensory disabilities because it would be nearly impossible to create. The only factor is that your dog is trained to perform work or tasks you would otherwise have difficulty completing due to your disability.
               <span class="br"/>
               Under the law, people are allowed to ask you what specific physical tasks your dog performs and you should be prepared to explain. Providing comfort or emotional support are not qualifying tasks.

               <div class="lm-heading">
                  Be prepared to Answer Questions
               </div>

               Under the law, people are prohibited from asking you about your disability. However, you may be asked to describe the work or tasks your dog is trained to perform. This could reveal the nature of your disability. This may be unavoidable, however you are allowed to choose to share trained work or tasks that are less revealing.
               <span class="br"/>
               Saying “I am blind” or “I have multiple sclerosis” or “I have PTSD” do not describe tasks or work.  Under federal law, people may ask you two questions:
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     Is this a service dog?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     What work or tasks has this dog been trained to perform?
                  </li>
               </ol>

               Anything your dog does naturally or has taught itself to do does not qualify as a task or work. As well, any behavior that most dogs do naturally does not qualify as a task or work.
