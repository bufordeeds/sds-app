               The law states:
               <span class="br"></span>
               (a) It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit, including public and common use areas.
               <span class="br"></span>
               (b) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
               <span class="br"></span>
               Example (1): A blind applicant for rental housing wants live in a dwelling unit with a seeing eye dog. The building has a no pets policy. It is a violation of ยง100.204 for the owner or manager of the apartment complex to refuse to permit the applicant to live in the apartment with a seeing eye dog because, without the seeing eye dog, the blind person will not have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
               <span class="br"></span>
               Service Dog Standards does not provide legal advice. Please contact a qualified attorney.
