                  We were designed with input from hundreds of experienced trainers and Service Dog owners who believe
                  there should be an opportunity for those who wish to voluntarily and knowingly comply with not only the ADA law,
                  but also an additional and specific set of

                   for their Service Animals.
                  Service Dog Standards goes above and beyond the ADA and the basic foundations of a Public Access Test.

                  Training and owning a service dog isn’t easy — but it shouldn’t feel like magic or unobtainable either. We strive to offer a way to display and document a Service Dog’s training and adherence to behavioral standards.

                  Our focus is twofold:
               </div>

               <p>
                  1. To provide a free and voluntary method for Members to formally state that they understand what is involved with training and using a Service or Assistance Animal; how important their behavior, and that of their Service or Assistance Dog is to the general public and other Service and Assistance Animal teams; the legal definition of a Service or Assistance Animal; the training standards defined by the Service Dog community such as the Minimum Training Standards for a Service or Assistance Animal and the Public Access Test.
               </p>

               <p>
                  2. To encourage education, training and exemplary behavior while providing a free and voluntary form of self-identification that can be used online or offline (the equivalent of providing a cape or vest for a Service Dog) for those who qualify under the ADA to use a Service or Assistance Dog. We hope to help encourage adherence to the ADA by requiring our members to understand that intentionally misrepresenting an animal as Service or Assistance Animal for any reason is not only unethical, it is also in violation of federal and local laws.
               </p>

                  A Higher Standard for Service Dogs and their Handlers
               </div>

               <p>
                  The purpose of Service Dog Standards is to add clarity to the process and responsibilities of being partnered with a Service Dog. At our heart, we encourage adherence to the ADA by requiring our Registrants to understand that intentionally misrepresenting an animal as Service Animal for any reason is not only unethical, it is also in violation of federal and local laws.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Service Dog Standards provides trainers and handlers the opportunity to voluntarily hold themselves and their animal accountable to a higher standard by publicly signing a specific set of training and behavior standards that goes above and beyond the law.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Service Dog Standards does not certify or authorize anyone to use a Service Animal — nor is certification required or recognized under the law. The privilege to use a Service or Assistance Animal is granted, under federal law, by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and local governments. If you are unsure if you qualify, please consult a local Service Dog trainer or organization.

            <!--      While Service Dog owners are allowed to verbally state their animal is a Service Animal for public access, many individuals find that having a way to say they have accepted further training and behavior standards, while not required by law, can help minimize discrimination and reduce access issues while keeping disability information private. This is especially important for disabled individuals who use a Service or Assistance Dog to help with invisible disabilities such as deafness, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and other conditions that may not be immediately apparent to others.-->

               Simply having a disability is not enough to qualify a pet as a Service or Assistance Dog. Those who pretend that they are disabled, or that their pet is a Service Dog so that they may gain entry to areas where the public is normally allowed to go, enter restaurants, fly in-cabin, stay in a hotel, apartment or condominium — or test the boundaries of what is legal or ethical are breaking federal law and should exit now and not sign this agreement. There are legal options for traveling and living with your dog which you should consider.
