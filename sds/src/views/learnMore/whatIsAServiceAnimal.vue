          The <a hrf="https://www.ada.gov/2010_regs.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) defines a Service
          Animal as: any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual
          with a disability, including a physical, sensory, developmental, psychiatric, intellectual, or other disability.

          <div class="lm-heading">
            Know Your Terminology
          </div>

          Service Animals are also known as Assistance Animals, Assistance Dogs, and Service Dogs.
          <span class="br" />
          Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) and Therapy Dogs are important types of working dogs, but they are not Service
          Dogs.
          It is very important to <a
            href="https://anythingpawsable.com/the-difference-between-service-dogs-therapy-dogs-emotional-support-animals-and-more/">understand
            the difference</a>.

          <div class="lm-heading">
            Specialized Training
          </div>

          These unique working dogs utilize their specialized training to mitigate their partner’s specific disability and
          the difficulties caused by the disability. They perform some of the functions and tasks that an individual with
          a disability cannot perform easily for themselves.


          <div class="lm-heading">
            The Owner Must be Disabled
          </div>

          In order to be a Service Dog, a dog must be partnered with a person with a disability that hinders their ability
          to function independently. Furthermore, the dog must have specific task training or work that directly lessens
          or reduces the impact of the handler’s disability. Without both of these pieces, a dog, no matter how well
          trained, is not legally a Service Dog.

          <div class="lm-heading">
            Under the ADA, Only Dogs Can be Service Animals
          </div>
          Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, do not meet the ADA’s definition of a
          Service Animal.

          <div class="lm-heading">
            Dog Must be Trained in Tasks Or Work
          </div>

          Service Dogs can be trained to assist with tasks and work related to a wide range of disabilities, including —
          but not limited to — deafness, blindness, autism, epilepsy, severely limiting psychiatric conditions,
          life-threatening allergies, diabetes, mobility issues, neuromuscular diseases, and many others, such as
          endocrine system, circulatory, or pulmonary irregularities. Some disabilities, like many neurological disorders
          or the cardiac condition POTS, are invisible and may not be apparent to others.

          <span class="br" />
          The work or tasks performed by a Service Dog must be directly related to the individual’s disability. Examples
          of work or tasks include, but are not limited to:
          <span class="br" />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Assisting individuals who are blind or have low vision with navigation and other tasks
            </li>
            <li>
              Alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to the presence of people or sounds
            </li>
            <li>
              Providing non-violent protection or rescue work
            </li>
            <li>
              Pulling a wheelchair
            </li>
            <li>
              Assisting an individual during a seizure
            </li>
            <li>
              Alerting individuals to the presence of deadly allergens
            </li>

            <li>
              Retrieving items such as medicine or the telephone
            </li>
            <li>
              Providing physical support and assistance with balance and stability to individuals with mobility
              disabilities
            </li>
            <li>
              Helping persons with psychiatric and neurological disabilities by preventing or interrupting impulsive or
              destructive behaviors.
            </li>
          </ul>


          The crime deterrent effects of an animal’s presence and the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort,
          or companionship do not constitute work or tasks for the purposes of this definition.
