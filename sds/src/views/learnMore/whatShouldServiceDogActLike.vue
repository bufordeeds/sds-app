            Your Service Dog’s Behavior — and yours
          </div>

          Behavior is the best indication of whether or not a Service Dog team — meaning the dog and human — is well trained. If a Service Dog or their human handler is interrupting a business’ daily operation with their behavior, causing problems in a housing situation or behaves in a way that is dangerous a manager or business owner has every right to ask the person to remove the dog from the premises, “Service Dog” or not.
          <span class="br" />
          Every Service Dog handler is solely responsible for their actions. You may not blame any group of people as a whole for the actions of a few, whether by race, nationality, religion, ability or disability. In other words, if a customer or tenant causes damage or is disruptive, the same logic and laws apply as if they had a wheelchair or no disability at all. Damage or disruptive behavior should be dealt with as if it was done by any adult or child. Examples of inappropriate behavior includes barking not related to signaling on cue related to a person's disability, growling, stealing food, knocking people over, jumping, or
          <a href="https://www.anythingpawsable.com/things-service-dogs-public/">other behaviors</a>.

            Things Service Dogs in Public Should and Should Not Do
          </a>

          <div class="lm-heading">
            Every Service Dog Team is Unique
          </div>

          Every Service Dog team has unique abilities, needs, and work styles. No two teams possess the same training since every disability is different. What works for one team may not work for others. However, it’s vital to note that every “real” Service Dog has one thing in common: they’re individually trained to meet the needs of a person with a disability.
          <span class="br" />
          This individual training specifically addresses their person’s needs. The behaviors, tasks, and work the dog does for their handler aren’t
          <a href="https://www.anythingpawsable.com/service-dog-tasks-must-be-trained/">“natural” behaviors or things any dog could do</a>. The training is precise and exact. The trained behaviors are on cue, reliable, and replicable. The dog’s response to the cue/command is predictable since it’s a trained behavior.
          <span class="br" />
          As an example, a Service Dog who is trained to nudge their handler’s hand when the handler becomes frozen in fear is different from a dog who naturally pushes and shoves with their muzzle. The second dog’s behavior cannot be predicted and it isn’t on cue. Therefore, it’s not a trained behavior and does not count as a Service Dog task, even if it’s helpful.

          <div class="lm-heading">
            Most dogs naturally provide emotional support
          </div>

          Most dogs naturally provide emotional support as part of their bonding. You can not train a dog to provide emotional support, however you can train a dog to provide deep pressure stimulation to ground the handler during a panic attack or to alert the handler to a person approaching from behind.
          <span class="br" />
          A dog who is not trained to reliably provide tasks and/or work that help their handler do things they couldn’t do on their own in response to specific cues or commands is not a Service Dog. Dogs in public masquerading as Service Dogs who aren’t Service Dogs do not possess the caliber of training necessary to work calmly and reliably.
          <a href="https://www.anythingpawsable.com/fake-service-dog-complications/">Fake Service Dogs create a lot of complications</a>
          for real Service Dog teams. Namely, they create suspicion and access issues for well-trained teams.

            Service Dog Behavior: General Manners
          </div>

          Service Dogs appear calm, relaxed, and able to focus while working with their partner in public. They should have good manners. They shouldn’t jump, bark uncontrollably, growl, appear out of control, or act scared of their own shadow. A dog who is afraid of everything or who is reactive cannot focus on their handler’s needs since they’re so focused on the environment.
          <span class="br" />
          When you see a Service Dog, it should be obvious the dog has specialized training. They should be calm and focused on their handler. The dog should remain by their handler’s side unless their handler asks them to be somewhere else or they’re doing a trained task that requires them to be away from their handler. They should not overly engage with the environment or with strangers.
          <span class="br" />
          Properly trained Service Dogs aren’t destructive, wild, or loud. Some Service Dogs bark in order to alert someone nearby that their handler needs help, but outside of trained task work, a Service Dog shouldn’t excessively vocalize. Service Dogs shouldn’t be reactive to other dogs they see out in public. They should appear calm and give the appearance of a focused professional most of the time.

          <div class="lm-heading">
            Service Dog Behavior: Training
          </div>

          Some Service Dogs perform 2 or 4 tasks, whereas other teams have <a href="http://www.iaadp.org/tasks.html">dozens of tasks</a>. Every team is unique. A trained Service Dog can perform their tasks anywhere the handler needs their assistance.


          <div class="lm-heading">
            Service Dogs Spend Most of their time on “Standby”
          </div>

          Just because you don’t see a Service Dog working doesn’t mean they aren’t — Service Dogs spend a lot of time on standby, waiting for their handler to cue them to do something.
          <span class="br" />
          Remember, you cannot ask to see a Service Dog’s task training, but business owners can ask the handler what work or tasks the dog performs for the handler. Handlers should have an answer that’s clear and concise.
          <span class="br" />
          Additionally, Service Dogs showcase specialized public access training. They don’t stand in the way or block people’s access to items. They down quietly under tables or chairs while waiting. The dog isn’t a tripping hazard or obstacle. They don’t spook or startle from common, everyday encounters like automatic doors, strollers, or shopping carts.
